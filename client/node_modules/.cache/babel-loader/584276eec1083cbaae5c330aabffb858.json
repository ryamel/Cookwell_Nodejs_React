It’s designed to protect us, our customers and the general Internet community from unethical, irresponsible and illegal activity. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>Cookwell customers found engaging in activities prohibited by this acceptable use policy can be liable for service suspension and account termination. In extreme cases, we may be legally obliged to report such customers to the relevant authorities. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>This policy was last reviewed on 28 February 2021. </p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Fair use</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;, as per our offer schedule. If your use is considered to be excessive, then additional fees may be charged or capacity may be restricted. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement and/or any action that harms or disadvantages any group, individual or resource. We expect our customers and, where applicable, their users (&ldquo;end-users&rdquo;) to likewise engage our Products with similar intent. </p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Customer accountability</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as well as for the actions of anyone using our Products with the customer’s permission. This responsibility also applies to anyone using our Products on an unauthorised basis as a result of the customer’s failure to put in place reasonable security measures. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>By accepting Products from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence to this policy on behalf of anyone using the Products as their end users. Complaints regarding the actions of customers or their end-users will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account in question. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>If a customer — or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a result of the customer — violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to terminate any Products associated with the offending account or the account itself or take any remedial or preventative action we deem appropriate without notice. To the extent permitted by law, no credit will be available for interruptions of service resulting from any violation of our acceptable use policy. </p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Prohibited activity</h3>\n\t\t\t<h4>Copyright infringement and access to unauthorised material</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Our Products must not be used to transmit, distribute or store any material in violation of any applicable law. This includes but isn’t limited to: </p>\n\t\t\t<ol type=\"i\">\n\t\t\t   <li>any material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and</li>\n\t\t\t   <li>any material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat or violates export control laws.</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<p>The customer is solely responsible for all material they input, upload, disseminate, transmit, create or publish through or on our Products, and for obtaining legal permission to use any works included in such material. </p>\n\t\t\t<h4>SPAM and unauthorised message activity</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Our Products must not be used for the purpose of sending unsolicited bulk or commercial messages in violation of the laws and regulations applicable to your jurisdiction (“spam”).

All messaging lists run on or hosted by our Products must be &ldquo;confirmed opt-in&rdquo;. Verification of the address or telephone number owner’s express permission must be available for the lifespan of the messaging list. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>We prohibit the use of email lists, telephone number lists or databases purchased from third parties intended for spam or unconfirmed messaging list purposes on our Products. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>This spam and unauthorised message activity policy applies to messages sent using our Products, or to messages sent from any network by the customer or any person on the customer’s behalf, that directly or indirectly refer the recipient to a site hosted via our Products. </p>\n\t\t\t<h4>Unethical, exploitative, and malicious activity</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Our Products must not be used for the purpose of advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available any software, program, product or service designed to violate this acceptable use policy, or the acceptable use policy of other service providers.
